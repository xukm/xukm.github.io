Fourth year Bachelor of Health Sciences student exploring the world through travel and statistics. I have a keen interest in analyzing data as well as how to best present it in the visual medium.

###Skills

* Familiar with Python, C, MATLAB, R
* Experience with writing Standard Operating Protocols
* Proficient with Excel, SQL, LaTEX

###Education

BHSc (Candidate), Honours Bachelors of Health Sciences, McMaster University, 2015

##Research

My current research interests revolve around statistical and machine learning methods with applications to healthcare problems and policies. Currently I'm focusing on decision trees and how they can be used to create guidelines or validate current early warning score systems in medical settings.

####Current Projects
* Early Warning Score Validation and Improvement: looking into the current Hamilton Early Warning Score system and identifying an appopriate threshold for rapid response team activation, as well as identifying which vitals signs may be more predictive of critical outcomes
* Personal Project: SEIR Model of Flu Transmission through a community
